# Advent of Code Solutions

I'm probably not gonna do all the problems, but I'm gonna pretend like I'm gonna.  

This workspace is convenient, kinda:  

- `generate.py` makes all the files for a year.
- `imports.py` makes all the import statements for me to copy into `Main.hs`.
- `Boilerplate` generates a `run` function that runs the solution given the year, day, and subproblem (A or B).
- `Advent.Types` has a `Solution` type that encapsulates a solution: parsing input and solving it.

Feel free to use this as a template for yourself, maybe add tests and benchmarks or something.
